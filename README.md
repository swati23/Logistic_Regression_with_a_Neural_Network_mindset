Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
In this,you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!


As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on cat vs. non-cat datasets. 
By this completion you will understand:

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learn how to minimize the cost function.

- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
